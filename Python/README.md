This Python-based payroll project automates the process of generating stylish PDF payslips and emailing them to employees using data from an Excel file. To get started, install the required packages (`pandas`, `fpdf`, `yagmail`, `openpyxl`) via `pip`, and ensure you have an `employees.xlsx` file with payroll details like name, email, salary, allowances, and deductions. The script calculates net salary, formats the data into professional PDF payslips (with optional company logo), saves them in a `payslips/` folder, and sends them via Gmail. For secure email sending, set up a Gmail App Password and either hardcode it or load it using environment variables. Simply run `python Payroll.py` to generate and email payslips for each employee automatically.
